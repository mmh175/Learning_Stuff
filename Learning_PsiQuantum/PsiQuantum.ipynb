    "### Scalable Quantum Computer\n",
    "\n",
    "In quantum computing, scalability is somewhat related to modularity. </br>\n",
    "In classical computing, scalability refers to the ability to add more hardware to enhance performance. </br>\n",
    "In quantum computing, scalability means i) adding qubits ii) maintaining coherence iii) minimizing noise/errors in quantum state to enhance performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Adding another ssd or ram will enhance performance in classical computing. But in quantum realm, adding more qubits does not guarantee increase in performance. So, to be a `Scalable Quantum Computer`, one needs to take care other factors as well.\n",

    "### Fault Tolerant Quantum Computer\n",
    "\n",
    "A fault-tolerant quantum computer is a type of quantum computer designed to perform accurate calculations even when some quantum bits (qubits) experience errors or noise. This is achieved by using error-correcting codes that detect and correct errors without disrupting the quantum computation.\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, fault-tolerant quantum computers need to use a lot more qubits than usual to handle error-checking and correction, making them strong enough to withstand the common error rates in todayâ€™s quantum systems."

The measurement outcomes determine the next steps in the computation. In MBQC, this measuring process, based on the connections, is what actually performs the calculation, without needing direct quantum gates to control each qubit individually during the computation.\n",
